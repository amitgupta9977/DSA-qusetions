We have a array:-

let employees = [
    {
        "id": 11,
        "name":"Abhinav",
        "salary":75000
    },
    {
        "id": 2131,
        "name":"Gaurav",
        "salary":62000
    },
    {
        "id": 3012,
        "name":"Raj",
        "salary":32000
    }]
    
//output 1: we want to find out the employee whose salary is the highest.

  {firstName:"john",lastName:"Biden",age:26},
  {firstName:"jimmy",lastName:"cob",age:75},
  {firstName:"sam",lastName:"lewis",age:50},
