We have a array:-

let employees = [
    {
        "id": 11,
        "name":"Abhinav",
        "salary":75000
    },
    {
        "id": 2131,
        "name":"Gaurav",
        "salary":62000
    },
    {
        "id": 3012,
        "name":"Raj",
        "salary":32000
    }]
    
//output 1: we want to find out the employee whose salary is the highest.

Question2:-
const users=[
  {firstName:"john",lastName:"Biden",age:26},
  {firstName:"jimmy",lastName:"cob",age:75},
  {firstName:"sam",lastName:"lewis",age:50},
  {firstName:"Ronald",lastName:"Mathew",age:26},  
];

output:- Given an array of objects users, print fullname.

Question 3:- List of all firstName from array whose age is more than 30
const users=[
  {firstName:"john",lastName:"Biden",age:26},
  {firstName:"jimmy",lastName:"Cob",age:75},
  {firstName:"Sam",lastName:"Lewis",age:50},
  {firstName:"Ronald",lastName:"Mathew",age:26},  
];
